# SPOJ-BACKUP-TOOL
INTRODUCTION  At Sphere Online Judge (http://www.spoj.com) you are given the capability of trying out the challenging problems given. It also gives you the capability of viewing and downloading your own solution.  The tool SPOJ_BACKUP backups all your Accepted submissions and save them on the location of your computer where the script resides. The basic idea is to automate the process which can be used as a backup and an offline reference tool of your own codes.  FEATURES  Resume downloads. SPOJ_BACKUP currently supports resuming of the solutions if internet connection is disrupted  Incremental backup facility it'll not download the code already present on your local directory. Only newer code added in your "signedlist" will be downloaded  Proxy support !!. Proxy support is provided as SPOJ users are generally university students and they are generally behind a proxy and university firewall.  PS: The script was taken from http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577036-spoj-backup-script/ . It had bugs, which are now fixed. This script(debugged) works with the updated UI of Spoj.
